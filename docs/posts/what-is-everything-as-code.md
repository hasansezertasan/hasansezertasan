# What is `everything-as-code`?

`everything-as-code` or EaC is a concept that extends the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to encompass all aspects of software development and operations. It advocates for treating every element of the software lifecycle, including configuration, policies, and even documentation, as code. This approach allows teams to leverage version control, automation, and collaboration tools to manage their entire software ecosystem more effectively.
