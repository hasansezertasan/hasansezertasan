# What is `marimo`?

There are great advancements in the Python tooling lately. `ruff` shined with its linting and formatting capabilities. `uv` is a great package and project manager (along side with a lot of other features), `ty` and `pyrefly` are coming for the type checking and static analysis. They are all great tools that I use daily. And there is this one tool that I started using recently and I am loving it.

`marimo` is one of the best tools I have used so far.

I used to use Jupyter Notebooks (in VSCode) for almost everything. I used it like a REPL when I was writing Selenium Automation Scripts (I stopped it when I switched to Playwright). I used it for debugging too (don't give me that look). I used it whenever I wanted to experiment with code or try a new package. It was my playground.

Then I stopped when I switched to web development, but not without running Flask server in a Notebook (what a joke!).

I didn't actively used Notebooks for over two years now and I discovered a new tool that is very similar to Jupyter Notebooks but with a lot of features and great flexibility.

It's git-friendly (diffable), easy to use, and has a lot of features.

- It integrates with `uv` very well.
- It's executable, you can run it in the terminal!
- Testable!
- You can develop dashboards with it!
- Interactive plots and charts, check!
- Presentations, check!
- It works in the browser!
- And many more!

I ran a remote Marimo Notebook the other day and it asked me to run it in a Docker Container for security reasons. I just hit enter and it was fascinating!

I want to know more about this tool, and you'll be reading more about it (and maybe using it through the posts) in the next few posts.
